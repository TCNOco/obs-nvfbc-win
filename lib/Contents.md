## This folder contains:
### GL (Folder)
Contins `glcorearb.h`, `glext.h`, `glxext.h`, `wgl.h` & `wglext.h` from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry
[Even though i had to build it with vcpkg to get past linker errors anyways - idk where it is in there]

### obs
The libobs folder from the OBS source code.

### obs-lib
All of the x64 Release `.dll`, `.exp` and `.lib` from building OBS from source. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8TV9-MdMoY


Idk if I can distribute these source files, hence this info, but also you'll need them built anyways ~
